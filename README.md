# ArrayOfThings_AR
The [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) is a collaborative effort among leading scientists, universities, local government, and communities to collect real-time data on urban environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use. Our project attempts to visualize some of this data in Augmented Reality.

## Demo Video

Watch the following [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyFutnCHksQ) for a quick demo of the application

## Overview

Array of Things is an urban sensor project aimed at changing the way we understand cities and urban life. This project is a collaborative effort by various entities to capture real-time data in various areas of a city to help gain a deeper understanding of urban infrastructure and environment for research and public use. As a part of the initiative, various sensor nodes are placed at multiple locations in a city to gather data on the environment, air quality and light at that particular locations. The data gathered by each sensor is available via an API. Currently, the project is undertaken by many cities like Chicago, New York, Seattle, Alto, Seattle etc. Chicago has over a hundred AOT sensor nodes.
